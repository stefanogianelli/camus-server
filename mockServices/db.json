Indulging in fine dining, sampling the latest food craze, grabbing a bite on the go – one thing is for certain, New Yorkers love their restaurants. Begin your meal in early 19th century Manhattan, when New York was still just a small town and eat your way through the century as the concept of the restaurant evolved alongside the rapidly expanding Big Apple. Diners can expect dishes like Roast Duck, Mock Turtle Soup and Silver Shell Oysters along with wine pairings. Our host will explain how housing, gender roles and the influence of foreign immigrant cuisine converged to create New York&#39;s cultural mecca: the restaurant.

Located on the 9th floor of Le Méridien Chicago – Oakbrook Center, El Tapeo will offer two dinner seatings, each featuring a complimentary glass of sangria or sparkling champagne, as well as a festive party from 9 p.m. until 2 a.m. Guests who book the second dinner seating will be granted complimentary access to the party, also open to guests who are not dining to attend, featuring live entertainment from Cherry and The Definitives, party favors, and a midnight toast. \n\nThe first seating, offered between 5 p.m. to 6:30 p.m., until 8:30 p.m., will feature El Tapeo’s signature à la carte menu. Highlights include traditional Spanish tapas, such as Albondigas, lamb and bacon meatballs, romesco, toasted almonds & parsley; Tortilla Española made of confit artichoke, spinach, goat cheese omelet, romesco & crème fraiche; as well as a number of elegant entrees including Vieiras, pan-seared scallops, slow cooked lentil risotto, crispy kale & paprika honey migas; and Gambas a la Plancha, grilled whole prawns, chorizo sofrito, frisée & caper vinaigrette. \n\nThe second seating, offered from 9 p.m. until 10:30 p.m. will feature a prix-fixe, three course meal for $85 per person. The menu spotlights a number of El Tapeo’s most popular tapas, artfully constructed main dishes, and rich desserts.  First course options include Croquetas de Tocineta, ibérico bacon and pumpkin fritters with sage aioli; Gambas, sautéed shrimp, garlic, fresh herbs, smoked paprika, and piquillo pepper; Dátiles, fried medjool dates stuffed with marcona almonds and wrapped in cherry wood bacon; Ensalada de Pera, rioja wine poached pear, baby spinach, blue cheese and toasted almonds.

The prix-fixe option also includes complimentary access to the party.\n\nLive music will be provided throughout dinner and the party by Cherry and The Definitives, one of the most sought after live party bands in the Unites States.  The band entertains with a wide variety of music genres including Jazz, Latin, Pop, R&B, Disco, 80&#39;s, Motown, and current Top 40 Dance Music. Their distinctive style has mesmerized audiences (including our very own El Tapeo guests this summer), keeping the dance floor hot.

She frequently performs with various orchestras and has won numerous awards including F.A.M.E.&#39;s &quot;Best Female Vocalist&quot;.  Backing her up are The Definitives, comprised of some of the most top-notch musicians in the live entertainment circuit. \n\nReservations are required.

In order to receive this discount, guests must have a confirmed El Tapeo reservation for one of the options above. \n\nLocated in Greater Chicago directly adjacent to Oakbrook Center and steps from sophisticated shops and upscale dining, Le Méridien Chicago- Oakbrook Center is a destination of choice for visitors to the western Chicago suburbs.

From lightning fast picking, to sentimental ballads—playing storied original material, traditional songs, and contemporary covers—The Prowlers’ live show leaves no one wanting.Their most recent album “Breaking Ground” grew out of collaboration and time well spent, having completed it within months of multiple cross-country US tours and the band’s third trip to Europe. Produced by Greg Cahill (Grammy nominated band-leader of Special Consensus), with special guests Josh Williams (of Rhonda Vincent and the Rage) and Anders Beck (of Greensky Bluegrass), this recording packs punch after punch.The band recently performed with the US State Department on two separate trips in five different countries in Central and West Africa, as well as heading back to Europe in the spring of 2014 for their largest tour abroad to date. The Prowlers continue to push the envelope with their highly original songwriting, tight arrangements, and electrifying stage presence. With the bluegrass mantle on their shoulders and the best fans in the world by their side, The Henhouse Prowlers are here to stay for a long, long time. </p></p>","modified":"2015-12-05 09:24:19","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":{"performer":[{"creator":"artistdata","linker":"evdb","name":"Chicago Farmer","url":"http://eventful.com/performers/chicago-farmer-/P0-001-000195040-0?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"P0-001-000195040-0","short_bio":"No biography provided"},{"creator":"hhprowlers","linker":"evdb","name":"The Henhouse Prowlers","url":"http://concerts.eventful.com/The-Henhouse-Prowlers?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"P0-001-000102953-3","short_bio":"Chicago Bluegrass"}]},"title":"Henhouse Prowlers - Miles over Mountains","venue_address":"3855 N.

Formed in 2011, the band is based in the roots of traditional bluegrass music while pushing the boundaries and incorporating other styles into their sound. Their shows range from laid-back and intimate to a high lonesome, high energy, good time atmosphere so there’s a little bit for everyone.Dog 1 can play all the standards you know and love, but what really sets them apart are some great, unique covers (nope – I’m not giving it away, you’ll just have to come to a show and find out what they are) AND to top it off they have an ever-increasing collection of original songs – many of which are included on their upcoming EP, aptly titled: ‘Dog 1 – the EP’.So, bluegrass from Chicago? It happens a lot more than you might think. So come on out, see a show, pick up a CD and spend a little time with Dog 1… I promise you, you’ll be glad you did. </p></p>","modified":"2015-12-12 13:21:29","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":{"performer":[{"creator":"humcity","linker":"evdb","name":"Ekoostik Hookah","url":"http://concerts.eventful.com/Ekoostik-Hookah?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"P0-001-000048177-2","short_bio":"rock from Ohio"},{"creator":"DamonCawley","linker":"evdb","name":"Stretch","url":"http://concerts.eventful.com/performers/stretch-/P0-001-000105704-0?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"P0-001-000105704-0","short_bio":"Blues"}]},"title":"DOG 1 - Coyote Riot - Mad Bread - Pat Otto","venue_address":"3855 N.

For die hard rockabilly devotees and civilian music fans. Over the last decade, this highly organized vibrant jam session, held the first Thursday of every month at Martyrs&#39;, has become rockabilly central for many of the musicians & fans of Chicago&#39;s American roots scene. Although the monthly jam is devoted to rockabilly, the Big C Jamboree has also offered the span of &#39;40&#39;s-&#39;50&#39;s Amereicn roots music from Hillbilly Boogie to Western Swing, Jump Blues and 1st generation Rock-n-Roll. The night is run swiftly and simply: a host band performs a short set, followed by a myriad of roots musicians who do 3 songs each. The party like atmosphere includes socializing, drinking & dancing galore while the rotating line-up onstage usually features the raucous sounds of pompadoured rockabilly musicians wailing away on upright basses and hallow-bodied electric guitars; and there&#39;s NEVER a cover! It&#39;s one of the most dedicated evenings of music in the city. </p></p>","modified":"2015-11-21 07:25:50","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"title":"Big C Jamboree...
