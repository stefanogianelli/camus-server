Project overview
========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/stefanogianelli/camus-server.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/stefanogianelli/camus-server)

CAMUS is a framework to allow creation of context-aware mashups. This repository provide the server's implementation of CAMUS prototype. It's used by the mobile app to perform contextual searches, starting from the user's situation. The server parse the context received by the application, then select the services that best fit this situation, based on pre-created rules. Once services are selected, they will be queried to acquire data to be sent to the client, after last steps of transformation and duplicates' cleaning.

Installation requirements
=========================

-   Mongodb (\^3.0.6)
-   Redis (\^3.0.6)
-   Nodejs (\^4.0.0)

Installing and running
======================

Clone the repository and execute

    npm install

to install the dependencies.

For tests running install globally the module [PM2](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2):

    npm install pm2 -g

Running
=======

Make sure that a mongodb and redis daemon instances are running. Then:

    npm start


Docker
======

It's possible to execute the application on a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container. Make sure to install also [Docker Compose](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-compose).
First build the container with the command:

    docker-compose build

Then run the container:

    docker-compose up

To get the docker machine's ip address execute the command:

    docker-machine ls

Note: get only the ip address becuase the mapped port for CAMUS remain 3001.

For the first run assure to create the entries in the database using the /createDatabase endpoint

Note for MAC OS X users: if you get the error message:

    Couldn't connect to Docker daemon - you might need to run `docker-machine start default`.

execute first:

    eval "$(docker-machine env default)"

Test
====

Make sure that a mongodb and redis daemon instances are running.

Running the test cases with command:

    npm test

or to produce a coverage report execute:

    npm run cover

The report will be created in the folder called 'coverage' inside the project's root folder.

Endpoints
=========

By default the server's address is [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)

The available endpoint is:

* **GET /graphql**: graphiql interface for making queries in GraphQL style. Documentation about allowed input and output fields is available in the "Docs" section, on top-right corner of the page

Database Creator Tool
=====================

Tool to populate the database with sample data. This tool is not pushed to git due to private API keys in it. To load data in the database execute command:

    node databaseCreator.js

This will first delete all the existent tables then recreate them from scratch.
